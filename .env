# Only required for OAuth:

# Sandbox Mode:

# Set the PLAID_SANDBOX_REDIRECT_URI below to 'http://localhost:3001/oauth-link'.

# The OAuth redirect flow requires an endpoint on the developer's website

# that the bank website should redirect to. You will also need to configure

# this redirect URI for your client ID through the Plaid developer dashboard

# at https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api.

# Development mode:

# When running in development mode, you must use an https:// url.

# You will need to configure this https:// redirect URI in the Plaid developer dashboard.

# If your system is not set up to run localhost with https://, you will be unable to test

# the OAuth in development and should leave the PLAID_DEVELOPMENT_REDIRECT_URI blank.
